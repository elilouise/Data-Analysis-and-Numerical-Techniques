# Scientific-Programming

This is a repo of my scientific computing records.

Here you'll find code for the following:


 - Basic data analysis and statistics (linear least-squares regression)
 - Data fitting and analysis techniques (linear and non-linear least-squares regression, model fitting, correlation and interpolation for analysis of data sets.)
 - Statistical hypothesis testing.
 - Graph plotting (with error bars and etc..)

Code written in python 3 (Libraries utilized: Numpy, matplotlib, pandas etc..)
